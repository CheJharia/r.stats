#BIOL5081: Biostatistics Intro
The first six weeks of the course will cover data science & fundamental exploratory data analysis in r.  It is a brief introduction to the contemporary open science, best-practice data and biostatistical working tools. The primary goal is exploration of tools and approaches associated with effective, efficient, reproducible biostatistical analyses. Inspirations include [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org), [rforcats](http://rforcats.net), and many, more open, online, free I can direct you to as needed. The [description](http://biology.gradstudies.yorku.ca/courses/biol-5081/) provided by the university is a useful starting point in deciding if the Fall 2016 offering meets your specific needs.

###Lesson 1. Data science (DS).
want data. have data. will collect data.
assumption: in this course, you are here to work with data.
data literacy IS data science.

[The importance of data viz](http://datascienceplus.com/the-importance-of-data-visualization/)

Data viz first and foremost.

#Create four groups: setA, setB, setC and setD.
setA=select(anscombe, x=x1,y=y1)
setB=select(anscombe, x=x2,y=y2)
setC=select(anscombe, x=x3,y=y3)
setD=select(anscombe, x=x4,y=y4)

#Add a third column which can help us to identify the four groups.
setA$group ='SetA'
setB$group ='SetB'
setC$group ='SetC'
setD$group ='SetD'

#merge the four datasets

#If ever you must use a script, here is a template.
#You can have an R script that you source to do work for you within a main worflow.

###Lesson 2. Workflows & Data Wrangling (WDW).
worflows
reproduce. 
openly.

data wrangling
more than half the battle.

###Lesson 3. Visualization in r (VR).
basic plots.
lattice.
ggplot2.
you need to see data. see the trends. explore them using visuals.

###Lesson 4. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) in r.
fundamental descriptive stats.
GLM. GLMM. Post hoc tests.

###Lesson 5. Wrangle, visualize, and analyze.
A graduate-level dataset.
Apply your new mathemagical skills from scratch.
A single three-hour block.
As advanced as you want to be.
Fundamental principles demonstrated.
At least two fundamental statistical tests demonstrated.

###Lesson 6. Competency test.
deliberate practice.
tested with feedback.
a virtual repeat of last week but evaluated
