###Introduction to biostats
A brief introduction to the contemporary open science, best-practice data and biostatistical working tools. The primary goal is exploration of tools and approaches associated with effective, efficient, reproducible biostatistical analyses. Inspirations include [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org), [rforcats](http://rforcats.net), and many more once I complete prep.
